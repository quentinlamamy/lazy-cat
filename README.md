## About
- Created by Quentin Lamamy
- Fueled by 6 XL doses of coffee :coffee::coffee::coffee::coffee::coffee::coffee:
- Spent 30% of the time coding, 70% of the time convincing my cat to leave the keyboard :cat2:
- Debugged with the assistance of my rubber duck, Mr. Panda :panda_face:
- Guaranteed 100% bug-free (unless you find any) :bug:
- May the source be with you :sparkles:
